## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Then we will create our final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Results

Based on this visual it looks like riders have bikes checked out for around 10-15 mins.

This vizualization shows the length of time each gender checked out their bikes. Males seem to rent the bikes a lot more than any other gender.

5-6PM is the busiest time to bikeshare! We would want to schedule maintenance between 11PM and 5AM.

This image shows the busiest starting location for the bikes in NY.

## Summary

Based on the reports created, we can see that our main customers are Males who ride in the morning or right after a work day at 5-6PM. Another vizualization that would benefit us would be a vizualization that shows the average time in between bike repairs so we can create a regular maintenance schedule. Also, we could create a report that shows the reasons why females dont ride our bikes as much as males by a mulitple choice survey.
